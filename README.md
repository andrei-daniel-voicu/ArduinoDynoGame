T-Rex Dyno is an endless runner type game, drawing inspiration from the mini-game provided by Google Chrome's browser during an Internet outage. The primary objective for the user is to evade obstacles, and as they advance, their score will continue to rise."
This game is a project for Arduino, using a SH1106 display and two HW201 infrared sensors to control the actions of jumping and ducking. This game emulates the offline dinosaur game found on Google Chrome.
